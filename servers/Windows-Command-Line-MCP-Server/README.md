## Installation

### Installing via Smithery

To install Windows Command Line MCP Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@alxspiker/Windows-Command-Line-MCP-Server):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @alxspiker/Windows-Command-Line-MCP-Server --client claude
```

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16 or later
- npm or yarn
- Windows operating system

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alxspiker/Windows-Command-Line-MCP-Server.git
cd Windows-Command-Line-MCP-Server
npm install
npm run build
```

## Usage

### Command Line Options
- Default mode: Uses predefined safe commands
- `--allow-all`: Run in extended mode (with additional precautions)
- Custom command lists can be specified as arguments

### Project Creation
Create new projects safely with the built-in project creation tool:
- Supported project types: React, Node.js, Python
- Projects created in a sandboxed `~/AIProjects` directory

### Available Tools
1. **execute_command**: Run Windows CLI commands
2. **execute_powershell**: Execute PowerShell scripts
3. **create_project**: Safely create new development projects
4. **list_running_processes**: Retrieve active system processes
5. **get_system_info**: Collect system configuration details
6. **get_network_info**: Retrieve network adapter information
7. **get_scheduled_tasks**: List and query system tasks
8. **get_service_info**: Manage and query Windows services
9. **list_allowed_commands**: List all commands that can be executed by the server

## Using with Claude for Desktop

To use this server with Claude for Desktop:

1. Build the server using the setup instructions above
2. Add it to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "windows-cmd": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/dist/index.js` with the absolute path to the built `index.js` file in the `dist` directory.

3. Restart Claude for Desktop
4. You can now use the tools by asking Claude to perform Windows system operations

## Security Considerations

### Allowed Commands
By default, only safe commands are permitted:
- System information retrieval
- Network configuration
- Process management
- Development tool interactions

### Blocked Operations
Dangerous commands are always blocked, including:
- Disk formatting
- User management
- System shutdown
- Critical registry modifications

## Configuration

Customize the server's behavior by specifying allowed commands or using configuration flags.

### Example
```bash
# Run with default safe commands
node dist/index.js

# Run with specific allowed commands
node dist/index.js dir echo npm git

# Run in extended mode (use with caution)
node dist/index.js --allow-all
```
